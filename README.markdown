# Glitched Zareef

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/zareef26/pen/KKqxWJN](https://codepen.io/zareef26/pen/KKqxWJN).

Inspiration: http://www.theverge.com/a/luka-artificial-intelligence-memorial-roman-mazurenko-bot

The Verge is using centent: attr(data-text);  to make sudo-element copy of the text. I decided to try something a bit different and use some simple JQuery to copy the element instead.
The text-shadow works slightly different too since I am only copying the elements once, I am layering the text shadows to give it that RGB/CRT flicker.
The keyframe animations are copied and altered. 
Great work to the Vox team, the story and development are wonderful. You are a constant inspiration.
